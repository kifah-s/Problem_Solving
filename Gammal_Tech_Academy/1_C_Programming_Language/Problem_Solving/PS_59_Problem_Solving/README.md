Problem statement

Given a number N and an array A of N numbers. Determine if the array is lucky or not.

Note: the array is lucky if the frequency (number of occurrences) of the minimum element is odd.

Input

First line contains a number N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000) the number of elements.

Second line contains N numbers ( - 10^5 ≤  A[i] ≤ 10^5).

Output

Print "Lucky" (without quotes) if the frequency of the minimum element is odd, otherwise print "Unlucky"(without quotes).
